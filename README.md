# Para Bank

Para Bank is an online banking application designed as a sample project for testing and automation purposes. It offers a comprehensive set of functionalities that are typically found in a real-world banking system, including user registration, login, account management, fund transfers, and transaction history. The primary objective of this project is to simulate banking operations in a secure and user-friendly manner, providing a platform for testing and demonstrating various software testing techniques.

## Features

- User Registration: Users can create new accounts by providing their personal information and selecting a username and password.
- Login: Registered users can securely log in to their accounts using their credentials.
- Account Management: Users can view and manage their accounts, including checking balances, updating personal information, and changing passwords.
- Fund Transfers: Users can transfer funds between their own accounts or to other registered users.
- Transaction History: Users can view a detailed history of their transactions, including dates, amounts, and transaction types.

## Testing and Automation

Para Bank project offers a valuable learning experience for testers and developers interested in testing and automating banking applications. It provides hands-on exposure to various software testing techniques and tools, including:

- Manual Testing: Testers can manually verify the functionality, security, and usability of the application by executing test cases and analyzing the results.
- Automated Testing: Automated testing frameworks like Selenium and TestNG can be utilized to create robust test scripts that simulate user interactions, validate expected outcomes, and identify potential defects.
- Page Object Design Pattern: The project follows the Page Object design pattern, which helps in maintaining a modular and scalable test automation framework.
- Java Eclipses: The project is developed using Java programming language and can be easily integrated with popular IDEs like Eclipse for coding and debugging purposes.
- CI/CD Jenkins: Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines can be set up using Jenkins to automate the build, testing, and deployment processes.
- Maven: Maven, a build automation tool, can be employed to manage project dependencies, generate test reports, and facilitate the integration of external libraries or frameworks.
